# Nurse Rostering Project (Java)

## Overview
A Java-based nurse rostering application to create weekly/monthly shift schedules that satisfy hard constraints and optimize soft constraints. Intended as a starting point for research, competitions, or hospital staffing tools.

## Features
- Define shifts, nurses, skills and availability
- Enforce hard constraints (coverage, qualifications, rest)
- Optimize soft constraints (preferences, fairness, shift continuity)
- Pluggable solvers: constraint programming, mixed-integer, metaheuristics
- XML (ros) and Text input and output

## Tech Stack
- Java 11+ (or later)
- Build: Maven or Gradle
- Tests: JUnit
